[x] 37. December 20, 2025 - Added Reselection of Unselected Grid Points
   - Unselected grid points are now visible on the map in gray color (#d1d5db)
   - Gray points are smaller (radius 6) and have lower opacity (0.6) for visual distinction
   - Both selected (green) and unselected (gray) points are fully clickable
   - Clicking a gray point turns it green with a checkmark (selects it)
   - Clicking a green point turns it gray without checkmark (deselects it)
   - Only selected points display checkmark icons
   - Map hint updated to: "Click grid points to select/deselect"
   - Selected points: green, larger radius (8), full opacity, with checkmark
   - Unselected points: gray, smaller radius (6), reduced opacity, no checkmark
   - Counter still shows "X / Y" format for selected points
   - Workflow restarted and verified - application running successfully on port 5000
